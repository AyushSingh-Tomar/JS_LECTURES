// static imports


javascript modules allow you to break your code into files so that it is easier to maintain
a module may contain 
variable
function 
classes 
etc

we can export one module into another to use it's functions and variables into another module


There are two types of exports, 
1> Named exports
2> default exports


// JS modules only work in a strict mode that means no variable or functions declared in the module will be added automatically to global scope.
